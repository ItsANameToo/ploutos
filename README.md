# Ploutos

> A True Block Weight (TBW) payout script implementation for ARK

## Features

The most notable features of this payout script are listed below:

- True Block Weight calculation
- Configurable payout percentage
- Configurable delegate payout address and vendor field messages
- Whitelists
- Blacklists
- Payout address different from voting address
- Custom payout percentages per address
- Payout threshold
- Distributing pending balances from blacklisted wallets to active voters

## Requirements

- PHP 7.3+
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/)
- [Laravel](https://laravel.com)

## Installation

```bash
# Fetch TBW script
git clone git@github.com:ItsANameToo/ploutos.git
cd ploutos

# Setup
composer install
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
# Encrypt passphrase(s) with tinker
php artisan tinker
encrypt('first passphrase') # copy the encrypted passphrase to your .env file
encrypt('second passphrase') # copy the encrypted passphrase to your .env file
# Edit the rest of your .env file based on the variables in the next section

# Initializing TBW
php artisan migrate:fresh
# Poll current voters
php artisan ark:poll:voters
# Calculate payouts based on the blockheight that you last paid out from (height)
# Use --skip if you are not interested in polling earlier transactions
php artisan ark:migrate:blocks {height=0} {--skip}
# Check current pending balances of your voters
php artisan ark:earnings
```

## Environment

| Variable | Description | Example | Default |

| ARK_DELEGATE_HOST | The host used to fetch API data from | `"http:1.1.1.1:4003/api/"` | none |

## Usage

The script will poll for new blocks every 5 minutes and applies calculations when your delegate has forged a new block. There should be no need to manually intervene with the regular payout schedule after setting it up.

It is possible to whitelist (= include address in calulcations) or blacklist (= ignore address in calculations) addresses by adding them to the array in the `config/delegate.php` file.

Furthermore there are a couple of commands available that you can make use of, which are explained in the next section.

## Commands

Commands can be run by prepending `php artisan` before the commands, e.g. `php artisan ark:earnings` to show the current pending balances of your voters. Parameters with a default value (or ending in a `?`) are optional, e.g. `php artisan ark:broadcast` and `php artisan ark:broadcast 100` will result in the same action.

| Command | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `ark:broadcast {number=100}` | Broadcasts the last `<number>` of transactions in the database, useful for rebroadcasting a payment run |
| `ark:earnings` | Show the current pending balances of your voters |
| `ark:earnings:delegate:clear` | Clear the cached delegate earnings (does not reset voter pending balances) |
| `ark:send {amount} {recipient} {--smartbridge=}` | Send a transfer with the specified amount to the specified recipient with an optional smartbridge message |
| `ark:voter:payoutAddress {address} {payoutAddress?}` | Set a different payout address for the specified voter. Leave second parameter out to reset to default |
| `ark:voter:percentage {address} {percentage?}` | Set a different payout percentage for the specified voter. Leave second parameter out to reset to default |
| `php artisan ark:disburse:voters` | Perform a manual voter payout based on the current pending voter balances |
| `php artisan ark:disburse:developer` | Perform a manual delegate payout based on the current pending delegate balance |

## Disclaimer

Please note that it's up to the delegate itself to properly and thoroughly test this TBW payout script before using it in a production environment. It is adviced to try the script on devnet to get an idea of how it works and how it responds in case of errors. There will be no babysitting in case of errors, as you are smart enough to test things beforehand and try them out, right?
